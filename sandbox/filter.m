function [y, w] = filter(b,a,x,w)

# Filter a vector.
# y = filter(b,a,x) returns the solution to the following linear,
# time-invariant difference equation:
# 
#    N                   M
#   sum a(k+1) y(n-k) + sum b(k+1) x(n-k) = 0  for 1<=n<=length(x)
#   k=0                 k=0
# 
# where N=length(a)-1 and M=length(b)-1. An equivalent form of this
# equation is:
# 
#           N                   M
#   y(n) = sum c(k+1) y(n-k) + sum d(k+1) x(n-k)  for 1<=n<=length(x)
#          k=1                 k=0				     
# 				  
# where c = a/a(1) and d = b/a(1).
# 
# In terms of the z-transform, y is the result of passing the discrete-
# time signal x through a system characterized by the following rational
# system function:							
# 									
#              M
#             sum d(k+1) z^(-k)
#             k=0	       
#   H(z) = ----------------------
#                N
#           1 + sum c(k+1) z(-k)
#               k=1
# 
# [y, sf] = filter(b,a,x,si) sets the initial state of the system, si,
# and returns the final state, sf.  The state vector is a column vector
# whose length is equal to the length of the longest coefficient vector
# minus one.  If si is not set, the initial state vector is set to all
# zeros.
# 
# The particular algorithm employed is known as a transposed Direct
# Form II implementation.
